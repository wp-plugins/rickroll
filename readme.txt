This is not just a plugin, it symbolizes the hopes and ethusiasm of an entire meme, summed up into one word, made famous by the internet: RICKROLL.

== Description ==

The Rickroll plugin converts your embedded videos into Rick Astley's "Never Gonna Give You Up." Activate it and that's what it does. Deactivate and they go back to normal. If there's no Rickroll video on the embed's site, it defaults to YouTube's 'official' RickRoll video.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What Is Rickrolling? =
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickrolling">Rickrolling</a> is the fine art of pretending to show one video, and substituting it with another.

= Why did you do this? =
My Tivo box died and I was a little bored.

= Why does my video switch to YouTube? =
Becuase not every video site has a self-hosted Rickroll, so in those instances, it defaults to the YouTube 'official' RickRoll video.
